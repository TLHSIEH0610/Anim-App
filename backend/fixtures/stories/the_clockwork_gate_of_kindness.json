  "description": "A brave little child reaches a dim castle with a clockwork gate that won’t open. Instead of forcing it, the child listens, finds a missing gear-key, and even calms a scared little dragon whose sparks could cause trouble. With gentle patience, the child fixes the gate and brings the castle’s warm lights back—showing that kindness and calm can solve big problems.",
